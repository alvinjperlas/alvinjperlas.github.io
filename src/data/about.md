# Intro

Hello! My name is Alvin Perlas, and I'm a software engineer. I'am very passionate about learning new things and  emerging technology stacks. 
I am also a technology enthusiast where I prototype solution into devices to my common day to day problems. I believe that if a problem has bothered you enough, there must be some solution we could craft to resolve it by means of existing technology or making it yourself (DIY). 

# Currently

I am adept in Object Oriented Programming with extensive experience in the most common programming languages to date (Python, Java, C/C++, C#). Although I tend to favor Python on my normal day-to-day at home development as it is 1.) pre-loaded on a raspberry-pi, 2.) I can easily capture the algorithms I have with simple lines of code instead of defining a full page of data types and classes (ehem, java). None the less, I believe each programming language has it's strengths and weaknesses and it's important to know those facts given the choice to choose from them at what environment it's going to be deployed in.
