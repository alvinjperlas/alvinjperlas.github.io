My name is Alvin Perlas, and I'm a software engineer. I'am very passionate about learning new things and  emerging technology stacks. \nI am also a technology enthusiast where I prototype solution into devices to my common day to day problems. I believe that if a problem has bothered you enough, there must be some solution we could craft to resolve it by means of existing technology or making it yourself (DIY). \n\n# Currently\n\nI am adept in Object Oriented Programming with extensive experience in the most common programming languages to date (Python, Java, C/C++, C#). Although I tend to favor Python on my normal day-to-day at home development as it is 1.) pre-loaded on a raspberry-pi, 2.) I can easily capture the algorithms I have with simple lines of code instead of defining a full page of data types and classes (ehem, java). None the less, I believe each programming language has it's strengths and weaknesses and it's important to know those facts given the choice to choose from them at what environment it's going to be deployed in. \n\n# Programming Skills \n\nProgramming Languages: \n\n- Python, Java, C/C++, C# DotNet, JavaScript, Swift, Objective-C, \n\nFrontEnd Frameworks/Tools/Libraries:\n\n- React, Angular4, Sencha (ExtJs), BootStrap, PyQT, Swing, HTML, Dhtmlx, JQuery, CSS\n\nBackend Frameworks/Tools/Libraries:\n\n- SQL, NodeJs, Express, MongoDB, JSON, AutoIt, \n\nIntegrated Development Environments I've used:\n\n- Visual Studio Pro / VsCode\n- Android Studio\n- Xcode\n- SQL Server\n- IntelliJ\n- Netbeans\n- Eclipse\n- Postman\n- Matlab\n\nVersion Control I've used\n\n- Git\n- IBM Clearcase\n\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- All the companies I have worked for, as it stands, ends with \"ON\".\n- I am a musician. I used to play in a band before having kids! \n- I am picking up archery as a side hobby.\n- I am Foodie. Always eager to try new foods.\n- If your team does not have a BOBA group, I will personally spearhead the effort to create one :)\n- I've been told that I can turn caffein into code. (whooah)\n\n\n",renderers:{Link:d},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
